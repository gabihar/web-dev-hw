13. My imaginary client was basketball players. They wanted the best gear for basketball.

14. Display:block is when an element is displayed as a block. Display:inline is when the element is inside the block on the same line. Display:inline-block is when the element is inline and is also a block element.

15. I created a pseudo classes, fallback and complimentary fonts, placeholder texts and images, divs, navs, the four main doc and meta elements, and links between the websites and stylesheet. I thought this assignment was pretty tough!
