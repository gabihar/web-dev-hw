14. Alt text is the contents of an image. We use it for web surfers to see if they can't see the image displayed.

15. ? I am really confused about the multiple source video element?? I still don't think I used it correctly.I am also unsure if I put the soundcloud and youtube video in correctly. I made an html again with the 4 main document elements and 4 meta elements. I added divs, classes, headings, images, audio, video, lyrics, copyright, and a Google Map.
