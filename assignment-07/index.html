  <h5>Lyrics</h5>
<p>
I saw her today at the reception <br />
A glass of wine in her hand <br />
I knew she would meet her connection<br />
At her feet was her footloose man<br />
No, you can't always get what you want<br />
You can't always get what you want<br />
You can't always get what you want<br />
But if you try sometime you find<br />
You get what you need<br />

I saw her today at the reception<br />
A glass of wine in her hand<br />
I knew she was gonna meet her connection<br />
At her feet was her footloose man<br />
You can't always get what you want<br />
You can't always get what you want<br />
You can't always get what you want<br />
But if you try sometimes you might find<br />
You get what you need<br />
But I went down to the demonstration<br />
To get your fair share of abuse<br />
Singing, "We're gonna vent our frustration<br />
If we don't we're gonna blow a fifty-amp fuse"<br />
You can't always get what you want<br />
You can't always get what you want<br />
You can't always get what you want<br />
But if you try sometimes well you just might find<br />
You get what you need<br />
I went down to the Chelsea drugstore<br />
To get your prescription filled<br />
I was standing in line with Mr. Jimmy<br />
And man, did he look pretty ill<br />
We decided that we would have a soda<br />
My favorite flavor, cherry red<br />
I sung my song to Mr. Jimmy<br />
Yeah, and he said one word to me, and that was "dead"<br />
I said to him<br />
You can't always get what you want<br />
You can't always get what you want<br />
You can't always get what you want<br />
But if you try sometimes you just might find<br />
You get what you need<br />
You get what you need, yeah, oh baby<br />
I saw her today at the reception<br />
In her glass was a bleeding man<br />
She was practiced at the art of deception<br />
Well I could tell by her blood-stained hands<br />
You can't always get what you want<br />
You can't always get what you want<br />
You can't always get what you want<br />
But if you try sometimes you just might find<br />
You just might find<br />
You get what you need<br />
You can't always get what you want<br />
You can't always get what you want<br />
You can't always get what you want<br />
But if you try sometimes you just might find<br />
You just might find<br />
You get what you need, oh yeah<br />
