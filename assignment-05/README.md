# Assignment 5
## Gabi Harrington

13. A document can have one <head> and one <body> on each page. What is different about the two is that the <head> always comes first. The <head> documents metadata and holds processed information. The <body> holds all the data and content that will be on the web page.

14. Structural markup is things like the header, the body, the paragraphs, etc. It is the structure of the page. Semantic markup is like making a line break in a paragraph or bolding a certain word on the page.

15. I made a website for my recipe. I made a head, a body with 4 different headings, an unordered list, and an ordered list. I used semantic and structural markup. I also created an HTML comment. The only thing hard about this assignment is that I would forget some of the codes and go back to old assignments to look at what they were!
