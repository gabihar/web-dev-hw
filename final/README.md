13. Web development was all new to me. Everything I was taught in this class I had never even heard of.

14. The same goes with web design. I truly had no clue what any of this stuff meant until now. It was really strange and cool to be able to see/know how people create web pages. I am glad I know how to design my own websites with background pictures, and use different fonts/colors!

15. I set up the page with document elements, meta tags, and a linked CSS file. I used divs, a drop down menu, structural and semantic HTML, input elements, a submit button, an image, media, colors, fonts, and positioning. I really enjoyed learning from this class! Thank you for letting me come in and helping me throughout the semester!
