  <!--John Mellencamp is one of my favorite music artists, so I will dedicate my final to his dude-->
  <h1>John Mellencamp</h1>
<p>John Mellencamp has several songs that standout to me as "great". But, this song has always been my favorite. It brings back memories of when I was a little girl at family barbeques or sitting on the patio with my parents during summer evenings.</p>

  <h3>Lyrics</h3>
<p>
  When I was a young boy,
  <br />
  Said put away those young boy ways
  <br />
  Now that I'm getting' older, so much older
  <br />
  I long for those young boy days
  <br />
  With a girl like you
  <br />
  With a girl like you
  <br />
  Lord knows there are things we can do, baby
  <br />
  Just me and you
  <br />
  Come on and make it a
  <br />
  Hurt so good
  <br />
  Come on baby make it hurt so good
  <br />
  Sometimes love don't feel like it should
  <br />
  You make it, hurt so good
  <br />
  You don't have to be so exciting
  <br />
  Just trying to give myself a little bit of fun, yeah
  <br />
  You always look so inviting
  <br />
  You ain't as green as you are young
  <br />
  Hey baby it's you
  <br />
  Come on girl now it's you
  <br />
  Sink your teeth right through my bones, baby
  <br />
  Let's see what we can do
  <br />
  Come on and make it a
  <br />
  Hurt so good
  <br />
  Come on baby make it hurt so good
  <br />
  Sometimes love don't feel like it should
  <br />
  You make it hurt so good
  <br />
  I ain't talking no big deals
  <br />
  I ain't made no plans myself
  <br />
  I ain't talking no high heels
  <br />
  Maybe we could walk around, all day long,
  <br />
  Walk around, all day long
  <br />
  Hurt so good
  <br />
  Come on baby make it hurt so good
  <br />
  Sometimes love don't feel like it should
  <br />
  You make it hurt so good
  <br />
  Hurt so good, come baby now
  <br />
  Come on baby make it hurt so good
  <br />
  Sometimes love don't feel like it should
  <br />
  You make it hurt so good
  <br />
  Hey, hey
  <br />
