<p>Dear Basketball, <br />
  From the moment
  <br />
I started rolling my dad's tube socks
<br />
And shooting imaginary
<br />
Game-winning shots
<br />
In the Great Western Forum
<br />
I knew one thing was real:
<br />
<br />
I fell in love with you.
<br />
<br />
A love so deep I gave you my all -
<br />
From my mind & body
<br />
To my spirit & soul.
<br />
<br />
As a six-year-old boy
<br />
Deeply in love with you
<br />
I never saw the end of the tunnel.
<br />
I only saw myself
<br />
Running out of one.
<br />
<br />
And so I ran.
<br />
I ran up and down every court
<br />
After every loose ball for you.
<br />
You asked for my hustle
<br />
I gave you my heart
<br />
Because it came with so much more.
<br />
<br />
I played through the sweat and hurt
<br />
Not because challenge called me
<br />
But because YOU called me.
<br />
I did everything for YOU
<br />
Because that's what you do
<br />
When someone makes you feel as
<br />
Alive as you've made me feel.
<br />
<br />
You gave a six-year-old boy his Laker dream
<br />
And I'll always love you for it.
<br />
But I can't love you obsessively for much longer.
<br />
This season is all I have left to give.
<br />
My heart can take the pounding
<br />
My mind can handle the grind
<br />
But my body knows it’s time to say goodbye.
<br />
<br />
And that's OK.
<br />
I’m ready to let you go.
<br />
I want you to know now
<br />
So we both can savor every moment we have left together.
<br />
The good and the bad.
<br />
We have given each other
<br />
All that we have.
<br />
<br />
And we both know, no matter what I do next
<br />
I'll always be that kid
<br />
With the rolled up socks
<br />
Garbage can in the corner
<br />
"05" seconds on the clock
<br />
Ball in my hands.
<br />
5 ... 4 ...3 ... 2 ... 1
<br />
<br />
Love you always,
<br />
Kobe
