<p>I'm Nobody! Who are you? Are you -— Nobody -— Too? Then there's a pair of us! Don't tell! They'd banish us -— you know!</P>
<p> How dreary to be -— to be -— Somebody! How public -— like a Frog —— To tell one's name -— the livelong June —— To an admiring bog!</p>

<p> This sends you to her biography <a href="about.html">Emily Dickinson</a>.</p>
