<hr />

<p>I'm Nobody! Who are you? Are you - Nobody - Too? Then there's a pair of us! Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know!</p>
<p> How dreary to be - to be - Somebody! How public - like a Frog - To tell one's name - the livelong June - To an admiring bog!</p>

<p> This sends you to her biography <a href="about.html">Emily Dickinson</a>.</p>
