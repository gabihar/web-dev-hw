13. I have seen a lot of submit buttons online. For example on an online quiz or homework. The submit button allows you to send someone information. I have seen the radio button for questionnaires. I have seen the input text used on homework assignments a lot!

14. A button input could be used for submitting a paper online or test. An example of a text would be writing a reply to a discussion board on Moodle, etc. A selection could be used for an online quiz.

15. I added the 4 main document elements, the 4 meta elements, the address element, an email link, a table, a form element with action and method attributes, an input element, a textarea input element, an input attribute, and a submit button. I was really lost on how to do the table for awhile.
