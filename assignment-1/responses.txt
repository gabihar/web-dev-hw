5. How is the web different from the internet? The web connects information while the internet connects participants. 
The web is a solvent, it makes materials widely accessible and available. The internet is a wire buried in the ground. 
The internet is made up of incredibly large numbers of independently operated networks.

6. How does the internet work? Again, the internet is a wire buried in the ground. 
Two computers connected to this wire can communicate. The computers we use are called clients and they are connected to the internet inderectly through an internet service provider. 
The stuff you send over the internet is delivered in packets and when it reaches its destination, the packets are reassembled in their original order. 
Eveything has an IP address. Routers direct your packets around the internet helping each packet get one step closer to its destination. 
Each packet is like a piece of candy wrapped in several layers. The first layer is your computers IP address, your computer sends the first packet to the router which adds its own IP address. 
Each time the packet reaches a new router, another layer is added until it reaches the server then when the server sends back information it creates packets with an identical wrapping. 
As a packet makes its way over the internet back to your computer. 
Each router unwraps a layer to discover where to send the packet next until it reaches your computer. 

7. What is the directory, and what is its relationship to files? 
A directory is a nesting of folders and file systems. Files are organized into groups which are the folders. 
So the relationship between a directory and files is that the files are stored in the directory. 

8. Why is using a VCS beneficial? 
One because of tracking changes. This is when a developer can make changes to a file at any time and track those changes. 
Two because of revert back. This is when a developer can make changes, but if they don't like the changes they can revert back to the original version. 
Three because of share and collaborate. This is when any associated parties of the files can see changes and fix them. 

9. State at least one thing you found interesting. 
I never knew that the internet and the web were different. I feel really uneducated by saying that.
